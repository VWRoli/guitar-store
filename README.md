# Mock Guitar Store E-Commerce website

<img src="src/img/store.png"/>

[Live Demo](https://guitar-store-site.netlify.app/).

### The backend is hosted on render.com

> Render spins down a Free web service that goes 15 minutes without receiving inbound traffic. Render spins the service back up whenever it next receives a request to process.

> Spinning up a service takes a few seconds, which causes a noticeable delay for incoming requests until the service is back up and running. For example, a browser page load will hang momentarily.
